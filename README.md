# Getting Started

Clone this repo using sourcetree or CLI - Or if ju just wanna play around and not commit anything can just download the zip file.
<br> Open up the project folder in vscode or ur pref IDE. (needs to be the whole folder, dont just open the src)
</br>

## Installing/Using NPM

Make sure you got node package manager installed on ur system. Run `npm --version`, if somethin pops up ur good. npm does have some built in backwards capablity. But if u run into problems installing packages or running/launching the website u might have to update ur npm version (im using 8.19.2).

## Installing Packages

Once you got npm installed, open a terminal in vscode (should automatically be in the projects directory - if not, cd till you get there)
<br> In that terminal run `npm i`. You'll see some crazy matrix lookin installs. You might see some errors and warnings, as long as none of them say "critical", you're good.
</br>

## Starting the Website

In the project directory terminal, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Making Some Basic Edits

If you want to play around, feel free to delete any of my code inside `App.js` it is all just me testing the packages. Anything you want to insert can be done by inserting code into the return of `function App()`.
